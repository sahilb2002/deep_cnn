# CLASSIFICATION USING NEURAL NETWORK
Problem statement:
                    **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster** Kaggle beginners contest
                        On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

                        While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

                        In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

                        My submission fetched 0.77511 public score.

Description-
            I used backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms to train the model.
            Also I implemented feature scaling, regularization etc.
